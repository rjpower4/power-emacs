#+TITLE: Rolfe Power's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Rolfe Power

* Introduction

This is my emacs configuration for personal use.
It is based off of several other emacs configurations.
It represents a departure away from the vi/m keybindings that I have traditionally used in my editors as I am /trying something new/.

* Desired Functionalities

** Org Mode

** Programming Languages

The programming languages that I am particularly interested in are listed here in alphabetical order:

*** C/C++

*** Clojure

*** Julia

*** LaTeX

** Non-Goals

*** LSP
