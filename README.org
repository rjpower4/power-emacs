#+TITLE: Rolfe Power's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Rolfe Power

This is my emacs configuration for personal use.
It is based off of several other emacs configurations.
It represents a departure away from the vi/m keybindings that I have traditionally used in my editors as I am /trying something new/.
